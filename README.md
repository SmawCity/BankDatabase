# Overview

I created this program to become more familiar with integrating SQL into Python. In this case, it serves the function of using that relational database to act as a fictional bank that deals in coins and assets.

# Relational Database

For this program, I use the SQLite library in Python. I made two tables (customer and asset) that hold data relating to each account and its contents.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code and the SQLite3 library.

# Future Work

- Allow users to see the ID's of assets tied to their account when withdrawing an asset
- Add a function to calculate the growth of value due to Annual Percentage Yield
- Make the program more robust when dealing with user input
